I try to make some [music](https://karmicresonance.bandcamp.com/music). I bake bread. I attempt to write. Colonialism, racism, and capitalism have ruined the world, but patriarchy is the ring that binds them. LeGuin and Delaney are my models for gender; politics from the Butlers (Judith and Octavia).  Find me taking out the garbage, washing the dishes, cleaning the cat litter, and catching things as they fall.
Part fae. I live in niches. I try to keep my consciousness centered, but sometimes my entire being is a diffuse cloud.git status
