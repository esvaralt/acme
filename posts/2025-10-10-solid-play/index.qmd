SOLID PLAY

Stars in bright daylight

	Where is the light?

Otters frolic near the shore

	How far the water, how far the land?

A blind turtle surfaces

	Where the light, where the water?

Diving, diving

	to the mirrored bottom

Otter feet to otter feet,

	Turtlehead to turtlehead

Starlight to sun

	Where the one, where the other?
