Canoe

Back straight

Reflection in the water


Canoe

Curved back

The sky in your eyes



Canoe

Straight ahead

The mystery prow



Lean one way, now another

Yellow spatterdock, white water-lily

Yellow water-lily, American lotus



*Nuphar advena, Nymphaea odorata*,

*Nymphaea mexicana, Nelumbo lutea*

Floating, a blossom

On the surface, the sky

Curve back, straight ahead

Lean one way, now another


Advena, odorata, mexicana, lutea.

Nuphar, Nelumbo,

*Nymphaea,*

Nymphaea.
